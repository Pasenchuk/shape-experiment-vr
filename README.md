Imagine yourself as a captain of ancient greek ship. Just relax and sink all 10 ships. Aim with moving your head, shoot by looking at enemy ships. You can use controller or gamepad for moving your ship.

If you want to create iOS or standalone build (for 3D tv and so on), use Unity engine. 
iOS support libs are gitignored (Assets/Plugins/iOS/). For adding them to project, get GoogleVRForUnity.unitypackage from:
